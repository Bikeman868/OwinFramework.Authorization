    <h1>Authorization middleware test site</h1>
    <p>
        To run this test you need to have a database of user identities. If you have any other
        web sites that use the <span class="code">Owin.Framework.Facilities.IdentityStore.Prius</span> NuGet
        package then you can use this database for these tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        This test site is set up with a custom implementation of <span class="code">IIdentification</span> middleware.
        This implementation is for testing only, it expects you to pass a user id in the 
        query string of your request, which it saves in a cookie for subsequent requests.
        To start testing as a different user, make any request with a different user id in
        the query string to update the cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that this user identification mechanism is helpful for testing but is totally
        non-secure and should not be used in real applications.
